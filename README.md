# drum-pad

## About
A fifteen pad drum pad interface built in Swift. At the moment it all the sounds are prebuilt in. Sounds can be played simultaneously. 

## Learned
This project was a good way for me to learn about the AVAudioPlayer library and how to play sounds via a button trigger.   

## Going Forward
Design a better UI, allow for drum pads to have their preset sounds changed, and add suggested presets to different drum patterns.
